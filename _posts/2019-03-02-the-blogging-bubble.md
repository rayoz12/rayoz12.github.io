# Hi There

**Hello world**, this is the first of one of many blog posts
that I want to write and it's my first post in the strange and mystrious bubble known as blogging.

I'll talk through some of the interesting technical
challenges I've faced and what i've done to overcome them.

Another purpose of this blog will be to document some of the work I do for future work. There are a lot of unfinished projects that I get taken away from and I want to return to them easily without having to relearn what I did again and again.

I hope you like it!
